    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Feijoada is a stew of beans with beef and pork. The name feijoada is
      derived from feijão, 'bean' in Portuguese. It is widely prepared in the
      Portuguese-speaking world, with slight variations. The basic ingredients
      of feijoada are beans and fresh pork or beef. In Brazil, it is usually
      made with black beans. The stew is best prepared over low heat in a thick
      clay pot.
