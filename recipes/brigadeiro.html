      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The brigadeiro is a traditional Brazilian dessert. The origin of the
        dessert is uncertain, but the most common theory is that it was created
        by a confectioner from Rio de Janeiro, Heloisa Nabuco de Oliveira, to
        promote the presidential candidacy of Eduardo Gomes. It is made of
        condensed milk, cocoa powder, butter, and chocolate sprinkles covering
        the outside layer.
